                     <p>The Dream Repair Serum contains 18 powerful ingredients, demonstrating a very high level of anti-oxidant cellular repair. The Beauty Chef's unique Bio-synergistic Blending (™) process blends ingredients to create a super charged formula, rich in anti-oxidants to repair and rejuvenate skin cells during the sleep cycle.</p>
                     <p>
                     Powerful Vitamin E analogues found in raspberry seed oil and acai berry oil work synergistically with carotenoids/ provitamin A found in tomato fruit and sea buckthorn berry to boost anti-oxidant levels up to 100 times. Scientific studies show that these two constituents co-operate very effectively within the lipid membrane to repair and rejuvenate the cell, magnifying each other's skin enhancing properties.</p>
                     <p>
                     The lipid soluble constituencies found in the serum such as polyphenols, mixed chain fatty acids and phospholipids provide outstanding emollient skin conditioning, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant protection. Also containing vitamins A, B, C, E, K and P and omegas 3,6,7 and 9, this formula is a profound rejuvenator, protecting and synthesising collagen; for a healthier, smoother appearance.
